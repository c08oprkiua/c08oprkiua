# Me Info:
* Christian
* Neurologically bad at staying awake (...\*insert caffeine joke here\*)
* The only jokes that offend me are things that directly mock my religion and God
* External contact: `@c08oprkiua` on Discord

# Programming info:
* Programming is my hobby, not my job; I don't, and won't, have nor set deadlines or ETAs for 99.9% of my projects. They're done when they're done, and they get worked on when I have the mental and physical energy and drive to do so.
* I primarily use GDScript and C/C++, with a strong preference for languages with static-typing
* Primary project interests:
  * Godot engine, leaning towards Godot 4 (and to a lesser extent, 3)
  * Writing code documentation
  * Writing tools, engines, and other things that help other developers (and myself)
* Secondary project interests:
  * Making games
  * Program optimizations and codebase refactors
  * game console homebrew

# Active Projects:
(I'm not gonna bother updating this one, just look at the recent stuff on my repository page lol)

# Consistently Semi-Active Projects:
These projects are either semi-actively worked on, or I at the very least have a persistent interest in completing/working on them. 
* Documenting Godot's platform APIs for the [Homebrodot Porting Godot wiki](https://github.com/Homebrodot/Godot/wiki/Porting-Godot).
* [Godot for Wii U](https://github.com/Homebrodot/platform-wiiu): *Very* early on port of Godot 4.2 to Wii U. Help wanted and needed.
* [ModuleAssistant](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/ModuleAssistant): A little GUI tool that automates the creation of various functions and other code, including variable set-gets and binds, to aid in the creation of Godot 3 and 4 C++ engine modules.
* [Flow Engine](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/flow-engine): a framework for making modern Sonic styled Sonic fangames, which I have ported to Godot 4, added several new features to, and fixed several bugs.
* [Space Game](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/space-game-rewrite): The Godot port of the multi-platform homebrew game. I am working on updating it to Godot 4 (from 3) and redesigning it to more "natively" use Godot's feature set.
* [VitaVehicle](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/g-rcp2/tree/godot-4.0.3-conversion) A realistic car physics routine for Godot 3 and 4. I mainly work on the Godot 4.2 branch, which is also what I am using as the basis of [a C++ engine module port](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/vita_vehicle_cpp).
* [Mii classes](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/Godot-4-Mii-Classes): A Godot engine module that adds/will add Mii integration features, in order to more easily work with Miis in Godot. Iykyk, but think of it as a Godot equivalent to libraries like RFL, CFL, FFL, etc.
* [aRAMa](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/aRAMa): A refactor and port of the popular [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) application for Wii U, to the Aroma CFW as a WUPS plugin. Help wanted.

# Effectively Shelved Projects:
The following are projects that I have lost most or all of my interest in persuing any further, but will still keep around in case anyone would be interested in picking up the torch for them in the future.
* [`gd_olv`](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/gd_olv): A (hopefully) easy to use Miiverse integration module, aiming to make Miiverse integration features easy to implement into Godot projects.
* [Inkay Engine](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/Inkay-engine): WIP modification of [Inkay by Pretendo Network](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay), with the end goal of implementing modular profiles for improving end-user QoL.
* [MiiTraverse](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/miitraverse): an app for accessing Miiverse revivals from a mobile device (primarily Android, but also other platforms).
