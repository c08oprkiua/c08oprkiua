# Projects
* Documenting Godot's platform APIs for the [Homebrodot Porting Godot wiki](https://github.com/Homebrodot/Godot/wiki/Porting-Godot)
* [Documenting the Miiverse game API](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/Miiverse-API-documentation)
* [Godot for Wii U](https://github.com/Homebrodot/platform-wiiu): *Very* early on port of Godot 4 to Wii U
* [MiiTraverse](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/miitraverse): an app for accessing Miiverse revivals from a mobile device (primarily Android, but also other platforms)
* [aRAMa](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/aRAMa): A rewrite and port of the popular [TCPGecko](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko) application for Wii U, to the Aroma CFW
* Godot 4 engine modules:
  * [`gd_olv`](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/gd_olv): A (hopefully) easy to use Miiverse integration module, to make Miiverse integration into Godot projects very easy to do.
  * [Mii classes](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/Godot-4-Mii-Classes): Mii integration features, in order to more easily work with Mii data in Godot.
* [Inkay Engine](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/Inkay-engine): WIP modification of [Inkay by Pretendo Network](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay), with the end goal of implementing modular profiles for improving end-user QoL.
* Two game/engine rewrites:
  * [VitaVehicle](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/g-rcp2/tree/godot-4.0.3-conversion) A realistic car physics routine for Godot 3 and 4, of which I mainly work on the latter version's branch.
  * [Space Game](https://github.com/c08oprkiua/space-game-rewrite): The Godot port of the multi-platform homebrew game. I am working on updating it to Godot 4 (from 3) and redesigning it to more "natively" use Godot's feature set.
* And more, not listed
